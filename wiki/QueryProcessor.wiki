#summary Describes the Linq support offered by sqlite-net.

= Introduction =

In order to make searching and retrieving your data easier, sqlite-net implements limited Linq support. This is done via the `Table` method available on `SQLiteConnections`.

The `Where`, `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, and `Take` queries have been implemented and translate to native SQL. This means that you can follow foreign keys, for instance, with just this code:

{{{
public class Favorite {
    [PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }
}

public class User {
    [PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; set; }

    public Favorite[] GetFavorites(SQLiteConnection c) {

        var q = from f in c.Table<Favorite>()
                where f.UserId == Id
                select f;

        return q.ToArray();
    }

    public static User TryLogin(string username, string password, SQLiteConnection c) {
      var hash = HashPassword(password);

      var q = from u in db.Table<User>()
              where u.Username == username && PasswordHash == hash
              select u;

      return q.FirstOrDefault();
    }
}
}}}


= Supported =

The following operators are available (see `TableQuery<T>.GetSqlName` for the current list):

    `GreaterThanOrEqual`, `LessThan`, `LessThanOrEqual`, `And`, `AndAlso`, `Or`, `OrElse`, `Equal`, `NotEqual`

The following expression constructs are supported:

    Binrary expressions (normal operators), constants, type conversions, and member access expressions.

Specifically, function calls are not yet supported. If you construct a query and a `NotSupportedException` is thrown, please [http://code.google.com/p/sqlite-net/issues/list file an Issue] so that support can be added.
